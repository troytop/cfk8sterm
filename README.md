# cfk8sterm

A web terminal for Kubernetes or Cloud Foundry workshops and demos using [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) in an [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/) container.

I use this primarily with [SUSE Cloud Application Platform](https://www.suse.com/products/cloud-application-platform/) but you can run it in Docker, Podman, or in any Cloud Foundry with `diego_docker` enabled.

It comes with: git, vim, curl, unzip, jq, cf, kubectl, and k9s
